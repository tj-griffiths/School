Investigation of integration methods for systems with discontinuous forces, particularly Monte Carlo methods for modeling self-interacting dark matter. Developed and implemented advanced numerical integration methods for systems with discontinuous forces, focusing on leapfrog algorithm optimization. Created a comprehensive error analysis framework comparing numerical solutions against analytical predictions for varying stepsize. Implemented drift correction mechanisms for improved accuracy in bounce dynamics and phase space trajectories.
